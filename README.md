# ThermalLabeler

**ThermalLabeler** is a utility for printing labels on thermal printers from Android  
without being tied to a specific manufacturer and without proprietary drivers.

The application acts as a bridge between Android and a thermal printer, providing full control over label printing where standard solutions do not work or become restrictive.

It solves a practical task:  
how to print a label from a phone or tablet to a regular thermal printer operating in TSPL mode.

Before printing, the file content is automatically converted into a raster layout, scaled to the actual label size, and prepared according to orientation, margins, and printer parameters.

## Label Templates

The application allows you to create and save multiple label templates with different sizes and print settings.

Each template contains a set of properties:

- label width and height  
- gap between labels  
- offset  
- orientation and rotation  
- alignment parameters  
- preprint (non-printable area)  

Saved templates can be reused and allow quick switching between different label types without reconfiguration.

## Direct Printing

Printing is performed directly:

- via Bluetooth  
- via USB  
- via Wi-Fi  

The application supports opening files (PDF, HTML, images) directly from the Android system.

When selecting “Open with” or “Share”, the file is automatically loaded into the application and prepared for label printing.

## Android PrintService Integration

The application works as an Android PrintService:

- available from the standard “Print” dialog  
- can be used by any application (POS software, browser, PDF viewer, etc.)

---

## Supported File Formats

The application allows opening and printing labels from the following file types:

- **PDF** — documents and layouts generated by other applications or systems  
- **HTML** — pages and templates, including automatically generated reports and price tags  
- **Images** — PNG, JPG, and other common formats  

---

## Print History

The application stores the history of completed print jobs.

For each job, the following are recorded:

- the original file  
- print parameters  

From the history, you can reopen a print job and perform reprinting without selecting the file again or reconfiguring label settings.

## How It Differs from “Typical” Solutions

- no A4 emulation  
- not tied to a single printer brand  
- precise label-to-label printing  
- full control over the entire print pipeline  
- suitable for warehouses, retail, logistics, and labeling

## Typical Use Cases

- printing price tags and barcodes  
- printing warehouse and shipping labels  
- printing from POS systems  
- printing from custom Android applications
