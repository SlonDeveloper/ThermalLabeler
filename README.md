# ThermalLabeler

ThermalLabeler is a utility for printing labels on thermal printers from Android
without binding to a specific manufacturer and without proprietary drivers.

The application acts as a bridge between Android and a thermal printer, providing
full control over label printing where standard solutions do not work or get in the way.

It solves a practical problem: how to print a label from a phone or tablet
to a standard thermal label printer.

Before printing, the file content is automatically converted into a raster layout,
scaled to the actual label size, and prepared with regard to orientation, margins,
and printer parameters.

ThermalLabeler receives print data, correctly scales it to real label dimensions,
and processes it using label templates.

## Label templates

The application allows you to create and store multiple label templates
with different sizes and printing parameters.

Each template contains a set of properties such as:
- label width and height
- gap between labels
- offset
- orientation and rotation
- alignment parameters
- preprint (non-printable area)

Saved templates can be reused and allow quick switching between different
label types without reconfiguring settings.

## Direct printing

Printing is performed directly via:
- Bluetooth
- USB
- Wi-Fi

## Android PrintService support

The application works as an Android PrintService, which means:
- it is available from the standard “Print” system dialog
- it can be used by any application (business software, web browsers, PDF viewers, etc.)

## Supported input formats

The application allows opening and printing labels from the following file types:
- **PDF** — documents and layouts generated by other applications or systems
- **HTML** — pages and templates, including automatically generated reports and price tags
- **Images** — PNG, JPG, and other common image formats

## Print history

The application stores a history of completed print jobs.
For each job, the source file and printing parameters are saved.

From the print history, a print job can be reopened and reprinted
without the need to select the file again or reconfigure label parameters.

## How it differs from typical solutions

- no A4 page emulation
- no binding to a single printer brand
- precise label-to-label printing
- full control over the entire printing pipeline
- suitable for warehouses, retail, logistics, and labeling tasks

## Typical use cases

- printing price tags and barcodes
- printing warehouse and shipping labels
- printing from business software and custom Android applications
